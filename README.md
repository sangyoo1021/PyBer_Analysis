From the multiple-line graph, each individual cities were analyzed by the months and by total weekly fares. From mid-February to March, there seems to be increase in the total weekly fares throughout three cities. However, urban and suburban cities tend to steady or decreased beginning of April, Rural city shows the highest peak in the beginning of month and gradually decreased throughout April. Suburban area showed strong comeback towards the end of April. 

##Summary

Though urban area recorded the largest total rides, due to the lower number of drivers, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver were higher in rural areas. By plotting in the multiple-line graph, it gave visualization of monthly trend of total fares by city type.
